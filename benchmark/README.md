phreak-examples: benchmark
==========================

Thanks to triceo, here is a jmh benchmark measuring PHREAK vs. RETE-OO performance on specific use-cases, where PHREAK should demonstrate its lazy (and more efficient) behaviour.

You can run the benchmark by building the project using Maven:

    mvn clean install

Then run the generated shaded jar:

    java -jar target/phreak-benchmark-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
