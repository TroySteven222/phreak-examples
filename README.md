phreak-examples
===============

Examples of situations highlighting differences between the new Drools 6 rule engine algorithm called PHREAK and its predecessor RETE-OO.

This repository contains two projects:

* phreak-examples - the original examples, referenced at DevConf 2014
* benchmark - the examples above rewritten into a more proper benchmark using jmh (thanks to triceo for writing the benchmark and psiroky for running it on a dedicated hardware)
